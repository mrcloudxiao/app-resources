    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025.10.10</p>

    <p>This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Space Dodge X</strong> mobile application (hereafter referred to as “the App”). The App is a casual arcade game designed for entertainment purposes. This document explains how we handle your data and what limited information may be accessed while you use the App.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App itself does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. No registration, login, or personal data entry is required to play.</p>
    <p>However, the App may use certain system frameworks provided by Apple to enhance your experience. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tracking Transparency (NSUserTrackingUsageDescription):</strong> The App may request permission to use Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework. This is used only for limited analytics or future ad attribution purposes and does not directly collect personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Anonymous crash reports and aggregated usage analytics may be collected by Apple or third-party frameworks through the App Store distribution system. This data cannot identify individual users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Tracking</h2>
    <p>If you allow app tracking, the following non-personal data types may be used to improve the user experience or measure app performance:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (e.g., IDFA or similar) for analytics or future advertising attribution</li>
        <li>General interaction data, such as session length and gameplay duration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No data is shared with third parties for marketing or profiling purposes.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect data from children under 13 years of age.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with external advertising SDKs, social logins, or other third-party APIs at this time. Any future integrations will comply with Apple’s privacy and transparency requirements.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Sharing</h2>
    <p>The App does not store or share any user data on external servers. All gameplay data (such as your best time or progress) is stored locally on your device and is deleted when the App is uninstalled.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will always be available within the App or its App Store listing, and the “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy or data usage, please contact us via this <a href="mailto:mrcloudxiao@gmail.com">email</a></p>
