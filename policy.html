  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025.10.19</p>

  <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Space Dodge X</strong> mobile application (the “App”). Space Dodge X is a casual arcade game. This document explains what information the App does — and does not — collect, how it is used, and your choices.</p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> The App does not track you across apps or websites owned by other companies, and it does not request App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permission.</li>
    <li><strong>No account &amp; no personal data collection:</strong> We do not ask you to register, and we do not collect personally identifiable information.</li>
    <li><strong>No payments:</strong> This version contains no in-app purchases or subscriptions.</li>
    <li><strong>Game Center enabled:</strong> Leaderboards are supported through Apple’s Game Center. See details below.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not collect personal data directly.</strong> The App does not ask for your name, email, phone number, precise location, or advertising identifiers.</p>
  <p><strong>Local gameplay data:</strong> Basic gameplay information (for example, your best survival time) is stored only on your device and is removed when you uninstall the App.</p>
  <p><strong>Diagnostics (optional):</strong> Apple may provide us with <em>aggregated and anonymized</em> crash logs and usage analytics through App Store Connect. These reports do not identify you and are used solely to improve stability and performance.</p>

  <h2>Game Center Integration</h2>
  <p>
    The App uses Apple’s Game Center service to enable leaderboards. 
    When you sign in to Game Center, Apple may collect and process limited data associated with your Game Center profile, 
    such as your player alias, Game Center ID, scores, and achievements. 
    This data is managed and stored by Apple and is not accessible to the developer of Space Dodge X. 
    We do not collect, store, or share your Game Center information ourselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can manage Game Center permissions on your device at: 
    <em>Settings &gt; Game Center</em>.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Tracking</h2>
  <p><strong>None.</strong> The App does not use tracking technologies to follow your activity across other companies’ apps or websites. The App does not access the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) and does not display personalized advertising.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Aside from Apple’s Game Center service (as described above), the App does not integrate any third-party advertising SDKs, 
    analytics tools, or external data collection services. 
    If we add optional services in a future update, we will disclose them here and on the App Store product page, 
    and we will comply with Apple’s privacy guidelines.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is suitable for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will promptly address the matter.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention &amp; Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not maintain servers for player accounts. We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties. Local gameplay data stays on your device.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You may delete the App at any time to remove all locally stored gameplay data.</li>
    <li>You can manage Apple diagnostics and Game Center access in iOS: <em>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security</em>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The latest version will be available within the App or on our website, with the “Last updated” date adjusted accordingly.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:mrcloudxiao@gmail.com">mrcloudxiao@gmail.com</a></p>
