    <div class="policy-section">
      <p>This Privacy Policy applies to the <strong>Space Dodge: Bullet Rush</strong> mobile application (the “App”). Space Dodge: Bullet Rush is a casual arcade game. This document explains what information the App does — and does not — collect, how it is used, and your choices.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>No tracking:</strong> The App does not track you across apps or websites owned by other companies, and it does not request App Tracking Transparency (ATT) permission.</li>
        <li><strong>No account &amp; no personal data collection:</strong> We do not ask you to register, and we do not collect personally identifiable information.</li>
        <li><strong>No payments:</strong> This version contains no in-app purchases or subscriptions.</li>
        <li><strong>Game Center enabled:</strong> Leaderboards are supported through Apple’s Game Center. See details below.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
      <p><strong>We do not collect personal data directly.</strong> The App does not ask for your name, email, phone number, precise location, or advertising identifiers.</p>
      <p><strong>Local gameplay data:</strong> Basic gameplay information (for example, your best survival time) is stored only on your device and is removed when you uninstall the App.</p>
      <p><strong>Diagnostics (optional):</strong> Apple may provide us with <em>aggregated and anonymized</em> crash logs and usage analytics through App Store Connect. These reports do not identify you and are used solely to improve stability and performance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Game Center Integration</h3>
      <p>The App uses Apple’s Game Center service to enable leaderboards. When you sign in to Game Center, Apple may collect and process limited data associated with your Game Center profile, such as your player alias, Game Center ID, scores, and achievements. This data is managed and stored by Apple and is not accessible to the developer of Space Dodge: Bullet Rush. We do not collect, store, or share your Game Center information ourselves.</p>
      <p>You can manage Game Center permissions on your device at: <em>Settings &gt; Game Center</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Data Tracking</h3>
      <p><strong>None.</strong> The App does not use tracking technologies to follow your activity across other companies’ apps or websites. The App does not access the Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) and does not display personalized advertising.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
      <p>Aside from Apple’s Game Center service (as described above), the App does not integrate third-party advertising SDKs, analytics tools, or external data collection services. If we add optional services in a future update, we will disclose them here and on the App Store product page, and we will comply with Apple’s privacy guidelines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
      <p>The App is suitable for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will promptly address the matter.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Data Retention &amp; Sharing</h3>
      <p>We do not maintain servers for player accounts. We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties. Local gameplay data stays on your device.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="policy-section">
      <h3>Your Choices</h3>
